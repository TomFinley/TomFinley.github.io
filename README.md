# Tom Finley's Personal Site

This is the Github pages repository for my private site, meant to be rendered
using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This is not meant to be publicly consumed
through Github itself, except perhaps as an example (whether or positive or
negative remains to be seen) of how to use Jekyll.

## Notes on Development

These are primarily notes for myself, since I tend to keep my sites for a while.
Greetings, future self! I hope you are still alive and well? In any case, just
as a reminder:

This uses a static site generator called Jekyll, apparently the current
preferred mechanism for creating a Github pages site.

you set up the bash script `test.sh`. If this is a fresh clone,
then either set it as executable or just run it using `sh` whenever you need to.

The [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] have information on Jekyll itself, with GitHub
Pages specific information [here][gh-pages]. Questions can be posted
[here][jekyll-talk].
