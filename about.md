I live in Bellevue, Washington with my wife Megan, daughter Aurora, son Luke,
and faithful dog-like cat Pippin. I work for Microsoft as a research software
development engineer. I received my PhD in computer science and machine
learning in 2008 from Cornell. As an undergraduate at Duke I majored in
computer science, and mathematics, and minored in economics. I originally hail
from Chagrin Falls, Ohio.

## A More Discursive About Me

For the first eighteen years of my life I lived in [Chagrin Falls, Ohio][cf], a
suburb of Cleveland, the child of two [actuaries][actuary], and the brother of
two older sisters.

It seems inevitable that a description of my life be largely centered around
computers. I'm not entirely sure how I should feel about that. When I was six,
my eldest sister helped me write my first computer program, but it was not until
I was eight or nine I started to actually learn how to program. I learned BASIC
from a summer computer camp at a local school, and my sister taught me Pascal
and later C. At around the same time, I got my first computer of my own, a [Mac
IIcx][IIcx]. This event precipitated my disappearance, as my mom sometimes
jokes, since I thenceforth spent nearly all my free time on my computer on
various hobbies. In 1993 I started a small and commercially unsuccessful local
BBS with Hermes II, an endeavor I gave up after about a year. In 1995 I started
authoring web pages, including SHTML and Perl for CGI scripts. Just prior to
college I taught myself C++, a language which struck me as a horrifying obtuse
overly-complicated corruption of C. Time and experience have only reinforced
this opinion.

I started my undergraduate career in 1998 at [Duke][duke] as an electrical
engineer. However, a lack of natural talent for electrical engineering sapped
any enjoyment I might have had in the field, so I switched out of engineering.
I wound up majoring in [computer science][dukecs] and [mathematics][dukemath].
In addition to regular coursework, I TAed the computer architecture course for
many semesters, competed in the [ACM ICPC][icpc] including the 2003 world
finals, and over summers worked for the computer science department on the
[JAWAA and JFLAP visualization tools][jflap] with [Dr. Susan Rodger][rodger].

There was a intermezzo of several months between undergrad and grad school,
during which time I wrote a [JFLAP book][jflap-book] with Dr. Rodger, and also
coded a [timer program][leaky-puppy-fob] to teach myself [Cocoa][cocoa]. This
latter project wound up getting a 4-mouse review in [Macworld][macworld].

Time had bent my interests towards the more theoretical and mathematical aspects
of computer science to the point where I wanted a career in academia. I thus
joined [Cornell's computer science department][cornellcs] as a PhD student, and
for five years worked under [Thorsten Joachims][tj] on machine learning and
structural SVMs. My thesis concerned the use of structural SVMs with
approximate learning. While five years as a PhD student disabused me of my
romantic notions of academia, on the whole I greatly enjoyed my time at Cornell
and my life in beautiful [Ithaca][ithaca]. Aside from my papers, extant
artifacts of my graduate career include Python interfaces to existing C/C++
software frameworks (Python had become my favorite language for many purposes),
most notably [SVM<sup>python</sup>][soft-svmpython2], [PyGLPK][soft-pyglpk], and
[PyGraphcut][soft-pygraphcut].

2008 was a whirlwind year for me. I met and married my wife Megan, completed my
PhD, and accepted an offer from Microsoft to join Live Search (later rebranded
as [Bing][bing]). So, I have since lived and worked in the Puget Sound region.
In this capacity I make good use of my skills in machine learning, statistics,
mathematics, and software development. In 2010, Megan gave birth to our
beautiful daughter, Aurora, and as a followup to this performance in 2013 gave
birth to our son Luke.

I have some pastimes outside of computers and mathematics. My three major non-work hobbies are writing, astronomy, and photography. For reading, my favorite authors are [Twain][twain], [Vonnegut][vonnegut] (who died; so it goes), [Dostoevsky][dostoevsky], [Borges][borges], and [Tolkien][tolkien]. My favorite TV shows are the usual nerd fare for someone my age: [TNG][tng], [B5][b5], [Buffy][buffy], [Firefly][firefly], and [BSG][bsg]. My favorite composer is [Chopin][chopin]. As an experiment I have <a href="http://blog.tfinley.net/">created a blog</a> to host informal self-indulgent content.</p>
