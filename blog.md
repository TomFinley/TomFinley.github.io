This blog is intended to serve as a repository for material more discursive and informal than the content on my homepage. I intend the homepage for limited information immediately relevant to myself, my longer term projects which have reached full maturity, and technical information. I intend this blog to be “the rest,” information on shorter term or underdeveloped projects, or even topics which captured my attention for an afternoon.
