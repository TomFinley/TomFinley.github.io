These are various things that I have composed for Duke's architecture course,
CPS 104, over my time as a student in and later TA for the class. These were
originally newsgroup posts or emails to instruct students. I modified them to be
more suitable to a more general audience for everyone's enjoyment. If you find
any errors, please send me an email to let me know.
