These are various things that I have composed for Duke's architecture course, CPS 104, over the times I've been in and UTAed for the class.  I have moved these to the Cornell server since I can no longer edit my old page at Duke.  These were originally posts or emails to instruct people, but they have been modified to be more suitable to a more general audience, and been put into friendly HTML styled format for everyone's enjoyment.  Please point out any errors I may have made.
