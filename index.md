I live in [Woodinville, Washington][wv] state. I originally come from [Chagrin
Falls, Ohio][cf].

I received my PhD in computer science and machine learning in 2008 from Cornell.
As an undergraduate at Duke I majored in computer science, and mathematics, and
minored in economics.

Since graduation, I have worked for [Microsoft][ms]. I am currently a principal
software development engineer, in the Azure Data group. Other groups I've worked
in previously have been Teams, Cloud + AI, and Bing. I tend to work on machine
learning tools and processes in my work at Microsoft. In addition to ML I often
work on API design and high performance computing.

My areas of expertise are boosting algorithms and linear algorithms, and machine
learning problems with "weird" multi-variate loss functions. In my work I've
tended to focus more on writing algorithms, tooling, and generally the
experience of using ML, than specific single applications of ML.
