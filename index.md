I live in [Woodinville, Washington][wv] state with my family. I originally come
from [Chagrin Falls, Ohio][cf].

I received my PhD in computer science and machine learning in 2008 from Cornell.
My advisor at the time was [Thorsten Joachims][tj]. As an undergraduate at Duke
I majored in computer science, and mathematics, and minored in economics.

Since then, I have worked for [Microsoft][ms]. I am currently a principal
software development engineer. I currently work in the Azure Data group. Other
groups I've worked in prior to that have been Teams, Cloud + AI, and Bing. I
tend to work on machine learning tools and processes in my work at Microsoft. In
addition to ML I often work on API design and high performance computing.

My areas of expertise are boosting algorithms and linear algorithms, and machine
learning problems with "weird" multi-variate loss functions. In my work I've
tended to focus more on writing algorithms, tooling, and generally the
experience of using ML, than specific single applications of ML.
