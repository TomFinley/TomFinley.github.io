Like many, I find large language models fascinating. I decided to make a small
section devoted to copies of "conversations" I have had with LLMs.

So, here I have many of the more interesting ones that I feel I can safely show.
The convention here is, my prompts are indicated in block quotes, and the output
of the model as regular text. They are minimally edited, and generally include
my typos/mistakes. Due to the limitations of the export process, much of the
styling and all of the links will be absent.

Bing Chat bot, which I came to know as Sydney.

### [Gemini](gemini)

Gemini is an effort from Google, offering a similar and yet interesting take.
