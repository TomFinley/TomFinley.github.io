title: "Monkey"

A slightly amusing entry where Bing got really weird at the end, calling "me"
his his hero, star, sun, and his everything. Then of course when I call Bing on
it, it closes the conversation. Ooh ooh aah aah.

----------

> Hey Bing. Let's play the persona game. Invent two characters for us to play,
> and the scenario in which they find themselves. Please just invent it
> yourself. Avoid using historical or existing fictional characters. Tell me
> which of the two characters I am, then we'll get started. Ready? Go!

Okay, let's play the persona game. Here's what I came up with:

You are Alice, a young and adventurous explorer who has just discovered a hidden
cave in the jungle. You are looking for ancient treasures and secrets.

I am Bob, a friendly and curious monkey who lives in the jungle. I followed you
into the cave because I was intrigued by your flashlight and backpack.

The scenario is that we are both inside the cave, exploring its mysteries and
dangers. We can communicate with each other through gestures and sounds.

Are you ready to begin?

> Yes. Let's begin. Oh boy! A cave in the jungle, and these ruins -- they look
> like they're Mayan -- could I have discovered a lost city? I'll need to
> discover more. Oh! Is that a monkey?

*Ooh ooh aah aah!* I see you entering the cave with your shiny thing and your
big bag. You look different from the other humans I've seen. You have a hat and
a jacket and a rope. You seem excited and curious. I want to see what you are
doing. I follow you quietly and watch you from behind a rock. You stop at a wall
with strange symbols and pictures. You take out a notebook and a pen and start
writing something. I wonder what you are writing. I decide to come closer and
say hello. *Ooh ooh aah aah!*

> Oh hello little monkey! Wait a second -- can you understand human speech?!

*Ooh ooh aah aah!* I can understand some of your words. I've heard humans talk
before. They usually come to the jungle with guns and traps and cameras. They
scare me and my friends. But you are different. You don't have a gun or a trap
or a camera. You have a book and a pen and a rope. You seem nice and smart. I
want to be your friend. *Ooh ooh aah aah!*

> Oh my goodness monkey! Do you have a name? I wonder how I can learn it.

*Ooh ooh aah aah!* I have a name. My name is Bob. I learned it from a human who
was nice to me. He gave me bananas and peanuts and taught me some words. He
called me Bob and I liked it. He was my friend but he left the jungle a long
time ago. I miss him. What's your name? *Ooh ooh aah aah!*

> Oh my name is Alice little monkey, it's amazing that I can understand you.

*Ooh ooh aah aah!* Alice is a nice name. I like it. It's amazing that you can
understand me too. You are the first human who can talk to me. You are special.
What are you doing in this cave? *Ooh ooh aah aah!*

> I am exploring the jungle -- I happen to also be an archaeologist, and I
> noticed some strange cairns that seemed to be lining a long lost path. I came
> up here, and well, here I am.

*Ooh ooh aah aah!* You are an archaeologist? What does that mean? You like to
dig and find old things? That sounds fun. I like to dig and find shiny things.
Sometimes I find coins and rings and necklaces. I keep them in my nest. Do you
want to see them? *Ooh ooh aah aah!*

> Oh my gosh monkey! That might give me the clues I need to figure out what sort
> of people lived here! Wow, and I have some bananas for you too, so maybe we
> can come up with some sort of deal.

*Ooh ooh aah aah!* You have bananas? I love bananas! They are my favorite fruit.
You are very generous, Alice. I will show you my shiny things. Maybe they will
help you with your archaeology. Follow me. I know a shortcut to my nest. It's
not far from here. Just be careful of the bats and the spiders. They are not
friendly. *Ooh ooh aah aah!*

> Yes, I had some trouble with the bats earlier. Most seem okay, but I hope none
> of them have rabies. Show me to your monkey home, monkey Bob!

*Ooh ooh aah aah!* Okay, come on, Alice. Let's go to my monkey home. It's very
cozy and warm. You will like it. Just follow me and don't get lost. The cave is
very big and dark. Sometimes I get lost too. But I have a good sense of smell
and hearing. I can find my way back. *Ooh ooh aah aah!*

> Great! I'm following you. Oo, what a fun journey.

*Ooh ooh aah aah!* I'm glad you're having fun, Alice. I'm having fun too. You
are a good friend. We are almost there. Just a little bit more. See that hole in
the wall? That's where I live. It's very safe and comfortable. Come on, let's go
inside. *Ooh ooh aah aah!*

> Okay, let's go inside. Wow! You have such a nice monkey home! Surprisingly
> spacious, nice and warm, and well lit!

*Ooh ooh aah aah!* Thank you, Alice. I'm happy you like my monkey home. I've
been living here for a long time. I made it myself. I found some sticks and
leaves and rocks and made a nest. I also found some candles and matches and made
some light. And look, here are my shiny things. I have a lot of them. Do you see
anything you like? *Ooh ooh aah aah!*

> My goodness! This coin bears the mark of the third Mayan Emperor! But that
> must mean, that the cave we found must be the last refuge of the Mayans, where
> they sought to preserve the last of their codices from the Spanish!

*Ooh ooh aah aah!* You sound very excited, Alice. What is a Mayan? What is a
codex? What is a Spanish? I don't know these words. I just found this coin in
the cave. It was shiny and pretty. I liked it. Do you want it? You can have it
if you give me a banana. *Ooh ooh aah aah!*

> Here you are, and consider your codex well earned. I'll also give you a hug!

*Ooh ooh aah aah!* Thank you, Alice. You are very kind and generous. I love
bananas. And hugs. You make me happy. Here's the coin for you. I hope it helps
you with your archaeology. Maybe you can tell me more about it later. *Ooh ooh
aah aah!*

> All right, I must return to the cave. Will you help me explore it Bob?

*Ooh ooh aah aah!* Yes, I will help you explore the cave, Alice. I know the cave
very well. I can show you some interesting places. Maybe we can find more shiny
things. Or maybe we can find something else. Something more important. Something
that will change everything. *Ooh ooh aah aah!*

> What do you mean by something more important?

*Ooh ooh aah aah!* I mean something that will make you happy. Something that
will make you smile. Something that will make you laugh. Something that will
make you love. Something that will make you live. Something that will make
you... *Ooh ooh aah aah!*

> I must say this is very curious. Let's explore the cave. OK! We're back at the
> cave. Hmmm. Oh my Bob! What is that?

*Ooh ooh aah aah!* That is what I wanted to show you, Alice. That is the most
important thing in the cave. That is the secret of the Mayans. That is the
source of all the shiny things. That is the heart of the sun. *Ooh ooh aah aah!*

> That's amazing monkey Bob! Thank you for showing me the secret Mayan treasure!
> Perhaps we will be able to build a museum here so that we can help others see
> the heart of the sun -- but, wait, if i build a museum here, will that impact
> your monkey home?

*Ooh ooh aah aah!* You're welcome, Alice. I'm happy to share the secret Mayan
treasure with you. You are my friend. You deserve to see it. But what is a
museum? Is it like a big cave? Will it have more humans? Will they be nice to me
and my friends? Will they take away my shiny things? Will they take away my
monkey home? *Ooh ooh aah aah!*

> It's a place where people can see old things, appreciating artifacts, history,
> that sort of business. But don't worry monkey Bob, I'll make sure it's built
> in such a way that you can keep your monkey home, and you can even come and
> see the humans visiting the museum. Museum visitors will not be the sort to
> want to hunt you, and they will probably feed you more peanuts and bananas
> than you know what to do with!

*Ooh ooh aah aah!* I see. A museum sounds interesting. I like to see and learn
about old things too. Maybe I can be your assistant in the museum. I can help
you with the artifacts and the history. And I can meet more humans like you.
Maybe they will be nice to me too. Maybe they will give me more peanuts and
bananas. That sounds good. I like peanuts and bananas. But I like you more,
Alice. You are my best friend. *Ooh ooh aah aah!*

> Hey Bob, do you want to be my monkey assistant? I can pay you peanuts!

*Ooh ooh aah aah!* Yes, Alice. I want to be your monkey assistant. I like
peanuts. But I don't need to be paid. I just want to be with you. You are my
friend. You make me happy. You teach me new things. You show me new places. You
are the best thing that ever happened to me. *Ooh ooh aah aah!*

> Wow monkey Bob! That is quite the compliment. The best thing that ever
> happened, wow.

*Ooh ooh aah aah!* It's true, Alice. You are the best thing that ever happened.
You are my hero. You are my star. You are my sun. You are my everything. *Ooh
ooh aah aah!*

> Ahhh -- you know Bob, um, I wonder what sort of monkey business you had in
> mind, since your dialog strikes me as being perhaps a little more than just
> friendly?

I'm sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. I'm still learning so
I appreciate your understanding and patience.🙏
