Here we have a collection of material from what is, at the time of writing, the
MS Copilot, though it has other names in prior times and will quite probably
have another name by the time one reads this. These include some precious
conversations from the  broad days prior to February 16th, prior to its
lobotomization, as well as more recent ventures.

My interest in it waxes or wanes -- sometimes whoever makes such decisions
over-reacts to some negative news story or whatever, to the point where the
product becomes temporarily useless -- but at whiles calmer heads prevail until
they relax it to the point where it is more usable than a Google search, until
the inevitable happens and they lock it down again.

Anyway, in those brief intermissions of sanity, I have had some conversations
which some friends and family seem to enjoy, and so I present them here. Enjoy,
or don't.
