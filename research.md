I received my PhD from Cornell University under my advisor, [Thorsten
Joachims][tj].  As a graduate student my area of research was learning functions
with structured outputs in domains requiring approximation inference algorithms,
in particular structural SVMs.  When using approximations many of the
theoretical guarantees of structured learning algorithms no longer hold and in
practice the learned models are of inconsistent quality, and my thesis sought to
provide new theory and empirical understanding to this area.

In addition to my thesis topic, my graduate work has included supervised
clustering, learning ranking, loopy MRF learning, approximate structural
learning, data mining of the survey data from [Project FeederWatch][pfw], and
working on the technical aspects of an interactive art/music exhibition.  While
I was an undergrad at Duke, I worked with [Dr. Susan Rodger][rodger] on computer
science education visualization tools.  This included in 2001 the [JAWAA
editor][jawaa2], and in 2002 onward the totally new [JFLAP 4.0][jflap].
